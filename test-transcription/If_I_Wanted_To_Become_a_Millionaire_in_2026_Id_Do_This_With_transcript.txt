[00:00] As we speak, AI is creating a new class
[00:02] of millionaires. And it's not just the
[00:03] coders in Silicon Valley. I'm talking
[00:04] about regular people with no technical
[00:06] background and zero AI experience
[00:08] either. And I would know this because
[00:09] I'm one of them. 2 and a half years ago,
[00:11] I had no AI experience. And since then,
[00:13] I've built multiple different AI
[00:14] businesses that have generated me over
[00:16] $7 million. I've built AI systems for
[00:18] some of the world's biggest brands, and
[00:20] I've built the world's largest AI
[00:21] business community and channel here on
[00:23] YouTube. So, in this video, I'm going to
[00:24] be giving you the exact blueprint to get
[00:26] rich with AI that I wish I had when I
[00:28] started. And it's the exact path that
[00:30] I'd be taking today if I was starting a
[00:32] game from zero. To make things easy,
[00:33] we're going to be splitting this path to
[00:34] a million into three key stages. The
[00:36] first phase is start, which is about
[00:38] going from 0 to 10K per month, and
[00:39] that's all about building an AI side
[00:41] hustle. The second phase is going to be
[00:42] scale, where we're going from 10 to 50K
[00:44] per month. And this is all about
[00:46] doubling down on what works. And the
[00:47] third and final phase is expand, which
[00:49] is from 50K to over $300,000 monthly.
[00:51] And that's really about becoming an
[00:53] industry leader. So to start, let's get
[00:54] one thing straight. And the path to
[00:56] becoming a millionaire isn't about
[00:57] saving your way there. That's the slow
[00:59] road that everyone tells you to take.
[01:01] But the real path is about radically
[01:03] increasing your income. Like radically
[01:05] increasing it. And for 99% of you
[01:07] watching, that journey is going to start
[01:08] with one thing, and that is building an
[01:10] AI side hustle that makes you enough
[01:12] money to allow you to quit your job and
[01:14] win your freedom. And this brings us to
[01:16] phase one of the millionaire plan, which
[01:17] is start. Your one and only mission in
[01:19] this phase is to get to that $10,000 per
[01:21] month mark. This is your freedom number,
[01:23] you could call it. It's the income that
[01:25] allows you to let go of your past life
[01:27] and go all in on building your dream
[01:29] life. And to do this, we need a vehicle,
[01:31] a a form of business that you can start
[01:33] on the side that doesn't require a ton
[01:35] of cash to get started and that
[01:36] leverages the single biggest trend on
[01:38] the planet right now, which is why you
[01:40] clicked on this video, artificial
[01:42] intelligence. Right now, the fastest and
[01:43] most direct path to that 10K per month,
[01:46] is starting a simple oneperson AI
[01:48] service business, also known as an AI
[01:50] automation agency. But what does this
[01:52] actually mean? That might sound a bit
[01:53] scary to you, but basically it means
[01:55] that you are going to help businesses to
[01:57] understand and use AI. You're going to
[01:59] be their guide. You're going to be
[02:01] helping them from everything from
[02:02] training the teams to consulting on
[02:04] where AI can help them best to actually
[02:06] building and setting up AI systems for
[02:08] them. And now, I know what you're
[02:09] thinking when you hear that. The first
[02:10] two objections that I always hear when I
[02:11] mention that are, "But Liam, how can I
[02:13] sell AI? I'm not technical and I don't
[02:15] have a computer science degree." And
[02:17] then secondly, even if I could sell it,
[02:19] AI is a huge and complex field. How will
[02:21] I ever know enough to be able to help a
[02:23] business? I know nothing right now. Give
[02:24] me a second. I'll just dismantle those
[02:25] right now because that is the biggest
[02:27] blocker stopping people from getting
[02:28] into AI is these misconceptions and
[02:30] myths around what it really takes to get
[02:32] in and learn and make money from it. So,
[02:33] we'll start with the nontechnical bit
[02:35] first. When I started my journey, I
[02:36] didn't have a computer science degree. I
[02:38] didn't have a PhD in AI. I had zero AI
[02:41] experience. I'm completely selftaught in
[02:43] my development skills and also my
[02:44] knowledge of AI. And yet from that
[02:46] starting point just 2 and a half years
[02:47] ago, my agency, Morningside AAI, has
[02:49] gone on to work with some of the world's
[02:50] biggest brands, including an MBA team,
[02:52] an NRL team, and even publicly traded
[02:55] companies. And at this point, across all
[02:56] my businesses, I'm making over $500,000
[02:58] per month. If I went from there to
[03:00] there, then you can definitely go from
[03:01] where you are to $10,000 per month. The
[03:04] reason for this is that the game has
[03:05] changed and that you don't need to be a
[03:07] developer or a coder anymore. The secret
[03:09] to getting into AI in this way is using
[03:11] simple no code tools that allows you to
[03:13] build basically any powerful AI system
[03:15] just by dragging and dropping. This is
[03:16] the first reason why this opportunity of
[03:18] selling AI to businesses in some form of
[03:20] an AI automation agency is so massive is
[03:22] that the door is wide open to it and
[03:23] anyone can get into it. Okay, so now
[03:25] let's deal with the second one about AI
[03:26] being too much for you to comprehend or
[03:27] learn in a short amount of time. to
[03:29] where the real secrets of how people are
[03:30] getting into AI lies. And it's that yes,
[03:32] the AI universe is massive. At my
[03:34] agency, Morningside, we are a general AI
[03:37] development agency. We can build almost
[03:38] anything that our clients want. But
[03:40] that's a very, very tough game to play.
[03:41] It requires a big team of expert
[03:43] developers who know everything, the
[03:45] whole AI space. But for a oneperson AI
[03:48] services business, you want to play a
[03:49] much smarter game than that. And that's
[03:50] called becoming a niched AI agency. Your
[03:52] mission here isn't to conquer the whole
[03:54] AI universe. It's to just become an
[03:56] expert in one of the tiny and valuable
[03:58] hotspots that are popping up right now.
[04:00] This is the core of the strategy I'm
[04:01] about to give you to get this AI side
[04:03] hustle off the ground. And I call it the
[04:04] AI solarreneurs blueprint. So to put
[04:06] this together, I've done all of the hard
[04:07] work and distilled everything into a
[04:09] simple and repeatable formula that
[04:10] answers the three questions that every
[04:12] beginner has when they're trying to
[04:13] start one of these businesses, which is
[04:15] what do I sell, who do I sell it to, and
[04:17] then how do I get my clients? So to keep
[04:19] this video from being hours and hours
[04:20] long, I'm going to give you the highle
[04:22] strategy here in this video on how to
[04:23] get this off the ground. But just so you
[04:25] know, I've created a complete 40 plus
[04:26] page guide that breaks down every single
[04:28] step on the way to getting this off the
[04:29] ground, including tutorials and
[04:30] templates. And I'll tell you how you can
[04:32] get access to that for free at the end.
[04:33] So, starting off, what do I sell? This
[04:35] is the most common question that I get.
[04:36] So, I've made it super simple for you
[04:37] guys. I have dug through all of the data
[04:39] from my community and from my own agency
[04:41] as well. And I've whittleled it down to
[04:42] just four of the most in demand beginner
[04:44] friendly AI systems that almost any
[04:46] business needs right now. So, these may
[04:48] sound scary as I go through them, but in
[04:50] the free guide that comes with it, you
[04:51] will have links to step-by-step
[04:52] tutorials on how to build each of them
[04:54] using no code tools, so there's no
[04:55] excuse why you can't get in there and
[04:57] get your hands dirty and start to build
[04:58] them. So, the first one is a speed to
[04:59] lead system. This is a simple automation
[05:01] that ensures that the business responds
[05:02] to any new customer inquiry or people
[05:04] reaching out to them in seconds, not
[05:06] hours. This is incredibly powerful when
[05:08] set up correctly because most deals go
[05:10] to the personal business who responds
[05:12] first. The second proven system is a
[05:13] WhatsApp or SMS booking agent. This is
[05:15] you can think of kind of like your local
[05:17] barber or restaurant where they might
[05:18] want to have something that allows
[05:20] customers to book or make appointments
[05:21] or reservations just by texting the
[05:23] business. So, it's available 24/7 and
[05:25] that's a massive convenience for the
[05:27] customers, but it also captures a ton
[05:29] more business. The third option is a
[05:30] social media DM agent. So, similar to
[05:32] the one before, but this is talking
[05:33] about going onto Instagram or Facebook
[05:35] where an AI agent can be set up to
[05:36] answer the common questions people have
[05:38] to handle any customer support or even
[05:39] booking appointments. So, this is going
[05:41] to save business owners, particularly
[05:42] small business owners, hours and hours
[05:44] per day. The fourth and final option is
[05:46] the AI receptionist. And every local
[05:48] business has a phone number and they
[05:49] often miss calls all the time because
[05:51] either the line's busy or they're
[05:53] asleep. And so this AI receptionist
[05:54] system answers the phone automatically
[05:56] for them and handles all the questions
[05:58] and customer support and can book
[05:59] appointments automatically so they never
[06:01] lose a customer again to a missed call.
[06:03] So those are the four proven AI systems
[06:04] that basically any business wants right
[06:05] now. That is what you're going to sell.
[06:07] All you need to do is follow the
[06:08] tutorials in the AI solarpreneurs
[06:09] blueprint that comes with this video and
[06:11] just see which one clicks with you and
[06:13] decide that is your thing and that
[06:14] you're going to master it. That is the
[06:15] one little area in the AI space that you
[06:17] need to become an expert in. The next
[06:18] step is figuring out who we're going to
[06:19] sell it to. So, we're not going to be
[06:21] going after tech companies. We're going
[06:22] to be going after the most AI clueless
[06:24] businesses that you can find like
[06:26] plumbers and roofers and contractors and
[06:28] home cleaners and things like this. And
[06:29] this is the second reason why this
[06:31] selling AI services to businesses is
[06:33] such a huge opportunity. It's that this
[06:35] is a starving crowd. These businesses
[06:37] have a massive knowledge gap. They are
[06:38] years behind when it comes to AI, which
[06:40] means just the simple system that you
[06:42] learned how to build before will seem
[06:44] like magic to them. Like your knowledge
[06:46] in this one little area will be light
[06:48] years ahead of where they are. And I
[06:49] remember my first client for Morningside
[06:50] was a AI sports betting system that I
[06:52] built on my laptop while I was still
[06:54] living in Dubai. And I was terrified. I
[06:56] felt like a total imposter. But I
[06:58] realized that I just had to be one step
[06:59] ahead of them. And that's all you need
[07:01] to be. And they will happily pay you to
[07:02] fill that gap. So the final part is how
[07:04] to get customers. So, the good thing
[07:05] about this is that you don't need
[07:06] hundreds. Your entire goal here is just
[07:08] to get four clients paying you $2,500 a
[07:10] month. And the fastest way to find these
[07:12] four clients as a oneperson AI business
[07:13] is with a simple cold email testing
[07:15] strategy. This is a distilled system
[07:17] based on what's working right now for my
[07:18] members in my AAA accelerator program.
[07:20] So, here's how it works. You're going to
[07:21] pick four of those boring and
[07:23] nontechnical niches that we talked about
[07:24] before. ET like HVAC or roofing or pest
[07:27] control or plumbers or home cleaning.
[07:28] Then, you're going to set up and send a
[07:30] simple cold email campaign to all four
[07:32] of those niches offering that one
[07:33] system. Now, based off the responses
[07:35] that you get, you're going to see which
[07:36] niche is responding to which offer with
[07:38] the most interest. So, maybe plumbers
[07:40] love the AI receptionists, but the
[07:41] roofers don't care. So, maybe you test
[07:43] all the AR receptionists, and you don't
[07:45] get any responses with those niches you
[07:46] tested. Okay. Well, I go on to the next
[07:48] one. I go on to the speeds lead system,
[07:49] and I test all those niches again. And
[07:51] eventually, you're going to find one
[07:52] particular matchup of a offer and a
[07:54] niche that is far more interested in
[07:56] responding at a higher rate than the
[07:57] others. And that is where you go all in.
[07:59] That mix of niche and offer becomes your
[08:01] narrow hotspot that you are going to
[08:02] become an expert in. Now, I know as a
[08:04] beginner this may sound terrifying. So,
[08:05] I have included a 20page guide on how to
[08:07] set up this exact cold email system in
[08:09] the AI solarpreneurs blueprint that's
[08:11] included for free with this video. And
[08:13] on a personal level, this is the part
[08:14] that truly drives me is because by
[08:16] starting this journey, you're not just
[08:18] building a side hustle. You're actually
[08:19] acquiring the most valuable skills on
[08:21] the planet. The income from starting
[08:22] these businesses, of course, amazing,
[08:24] but the real reward is actually the
[08:26] confidence and the security that comes
[08:27] from knowing that you're on the right
[08:28] path. And I I've felt it myself and I
[08:30] see it every day in my community. people
[08:32] are just like happier and more energized
[08:35] because they know that they're betting
[08:36] on the right thing and they've shifted
[08:37] out of something that they think is like
[08:39] a sinking ship or doesn't really give
[08:40] them the future prospects that they
[08:41] want. And that feeling is everything and
[08:43] that's really why I make these videos to
[08:45] try to give you guys that feeling. So
[08:47] that is the plan for phase one. It is
[08:48] not just a fantasy. It's a simple and
[08:50] repeatable formula. You learn one
[08:52] system. You find one niche of clueless
[08:54] businesses. You get four clients. You
[08:55] hit your freedom number. Once you've hit
[08:57] that 10K, you have earned your freedom.
[08:58] You can quit the job. And now it's time
[09:00] to go all in on scaling it. Phase two,
[09:02] scale from 10 to 50K per month. Now you
[09:05] were in the top 1% of people who
[09:06] actually take action on these kinds of
[09:08] videos. So the key thing here is that
[09:10] when you're working your job, handling
[09:11] those first four clients probably felt
[09:12] like a full-time gig in itself. But now
[09:15] you've just unlocked your most powerful
[09:16] asset, which is 8 hours a day of your
[09:19] own time to pour into the business. So
[09:20] this is where the real work is going to
[09:21] begin. This is where you get serious.
[09:23] And that brings us into phase two. So
[09:25] your priority in this phase is to scale
[09:27] from 10K per month to $50,000 per month.
[09:29] And this isn't about finding a new
[09:30] secret or a new business model. It is
[09:32] just about operational excellence. You
[09:34] stop just being a founder trying to get
[09:36] things and hustling off the ground and
[09:37] you start being an operator. You take
[09:39] the one thing that worked and you build
[09:41] an entire machine around it. And there
[09:43] are four key levers that you need to
[09:44] pull in order to make this happen. So
[09:45] lever number one is master the value
[09:47] equation and raise your prices. And the
[09:49] reason you do this is because you are
[09:50] now fundamentally more valuable. And you
[09:52] need to understand this to your core.
[09:54] When it comes to pricing your services,
[09:55] I have a simple formula that is really,
[09:57] really important for beginners to
[09:58] understand. And that is that your value
[10:00] aka the price you can charge is equal to
[10:02] your skills times your experience. When
[10:04] you started with your first client, your
[10:05] skills might have been maybe 30 out of
[10:07] 100 in that specific thing that you were
[10:09] trying to build. And your experience
[10:10] would have been zero. But as you've
[10:12] delivered on those clients, now you have
[10:13] at least four clients under your belt.
[10:15] You've seen what works and what doesn't.
[10:17] You understand how to get results for
[10:19] this kind of business. you're starting
[10:20] to see patterns and you understand the
[10:22] business owner's problems at a much
[10:23] deeper level. And this means you can
[10:25] offer your new clients a much higher
[10:27] chance of success and that is what they
[10:29] are paying you for. You're no longer
[10:31] just selling a promise of like, oh, I'll
[10:33] increase your leads by 20%. You are
[10:35] selling a proven result that you've
[10:37] taken from your past experience. And so
[10:39] with this new value, you can now change
[10:41] your pricing model. Instead of just
[10:42] going for a monthly retainer, like maybe
[10:44] 2,500 a month, depending on the system,
[10:46] you can start to introduce an upfront
[10:48] setup fee. for example, 5K up front and
[10:50] then $2,500 a month. This is going to
[10:52] immediately increase your cash flow and
[10:54] starts to filter out the tire kickers or
[10:56] lower value clients from the higher
[10:57] value ones. Lever number two is to
[10:59] systemize your proof. So, your
[11:00] experience that you've just got is
[11:02] worthless if you can't prove it to other
[11:04] people. So, your new obsession is to
[11:05] start turning those past results you've
[11:07] got into undeniable proof assets that
[11:09] you can start to plug into your
[11:11] marketing. So, the first thing you
[11:12] should do is get testimonials. So reach
[11:14] out to your first four clients, get
[11:15] written testimonials, or better yet, get
[11:17] them on a quick video call or ask them
[11:19] to record a video testimonial. And this
[11:21] kind of social proof is going to be gold
[11:22] and key for you to scale. Secondly, you
[11:24] need to build case studies. So create a
[11:26] simple onepage document for each of your
[11:28] clients. What was the problem? What was
[11:30] your solution? What was the result? And
[11:32] use the hard numbers wherever you can.
[11:34] So as you're going through your client
[11:35] deliveries, you want to look for things
[11:36] like we reduced lead response time by
[11:38] 98% or captured 30% more inbound leads
[11:42] from their phone line. Thirdly, you want
[11:43] to start building your brand. So, use
[11:45] all these assets that we've just got to
[11:47] start building a simple brand, which is
[11:49] creating a website or updating it. Start
[11:51] to post some of these case studies on
[11:52] your LinkedIn and then start to position
[11:54] yourself as the expert for the specific
[11:56] problem that you solve. Level number
[11:57] three is to scale your acquisition
[11:59] machine. So, now that you have all of
[12:00] this proof, you start to pour gasoline
[12:02] on your client acquisition system. So,
[12:04] your cold email system is already
[12:05] working. Now, you need to make it 10
[12:07] times more powerful by integrating your
[12:09] new case studies and testimonials
[12:10] directly into that email copy. Your
[12:12] outreach is no longer a cold pitch. It's
[12:14] a confident presentation of the proven
[12:17] results that you've gotten so far. And
[12:18] with your extra time that you've gotten
[12:19] from quitting your job, you can start to
[12:20] increase the volume of emails that
[12:22] you're sending and spend more time
[12:24] refining your scripts, doing split
[12:25] tests, and taking more sales calls,
[12:27] which are inevitably going to come from
[12:28] increasing that volume. Again, this is
[12:30] what the scale phase is all about. It's
[12:31] simply doing more of what's working, but
[12:34] now with a lot better ammunition. And
[12:35] finally, lever number four is to build
[12:37] your digital and human team. This is by
[12:39] far the biggest unlock for you in this
[12:41] phase where your goal now shifts to
[12:43] using AI and your first human hires to
[12:45] automate yourself out of the day-to-day
[12:46] work so that you can focus on what
[12:48] actually matters most, which is signing
[12:50] new deals. So, the first way you can do
[12:51] this is by setting up a digital team,
[12:53] aka using AI automation. You need to
[12:55] start using your AI skills that you're
[12:57] getting from your client projects on
[12:58] your own AI business. So, start to look
[13:00] at your processes. Where are the
[13:01] bottlenecks? Well, I can tell you where
[13:02] it's going to be, and that's on things
[13:04] like proposal generation. Are you
[13:05] spending hours on preparing proposals to
[13:07] send to clients? Well, there are tools
[13:09] like Genpark and their slide agent that
[13:10] can help you do that fully. Instead of
[13:12] doing it all by hand, you can start to
[13:13] take the transcripts from your sales
[13:15] calls or discovery calls, run it through
[13:16] Chat GBT to create a proposal outline,
[13:18] and then feed that into GenSpark to
[13:20] create a beautiful presentation for your
[13:22] client in minutes, if not hours. Another
[13:24] big one you're going to run into is
[13:25] contract generation. So, doing that same
[13:27] process again, taking the transcript and
[13:29] this time putting it into your own
[13:30] custom AI automation on something like
[13:32] make.com and getting it to generate you
[13:34] a ready document that's on something
[13:35] like Panda Docuign. And another massive
[13:38] bottleneck is going to be on client
[13:39] onboarding. So, if you can build an
[13:40] automation that handles all of these
[13:42] initial steps for a new client without
[13:43] you having to do anything, that's going
[13:45] to be a massive unlock for you and
[13:46] getting your time back. In the AI
[13:47] solarreneurs blueprint, I'm going to
[13:48] include a complete list of all the best
[13:50] tools for solo founders to build their
[13:52] digital team um that I use and many
[13:54] other people in my community use so that
[13:56] you can get more done with less. So,
[13:57] aside from using AI automation to build
[13:59] your digital team, you also can hire
[14:01] your first human. And for most of you,
[14:02] this is going to be a technical person,
[14:04] a developer or an engineer who can
[14:06] handle the client delivery for you.
[14:08] Basically replacing you and doing the
[14:10] setup for your clients. And I know this
[14:12] may sound scary, but if you do the
[14:13] maths, a good freelance AI developer
[14:15] might cost you $6,000 a month. And if
[14:18] that one hire frees you up to close just
[14:19] two more deals at your new higher price
[14:21] point, then they've already paid for
[14:23] themselves. So this one move allows you
[14:24] to focus 100% of your time and energy on
[14:27] sales and growth while your new hire is
[14:28] handling all of the delivery and client
[14:30] work themselves. So, as you can tell,
[14:32] this phase is a grind, but it's a focus
[14:34] grind. You are not searching for any new
[14:36] answers really. You're just executing on
[14:38] a proven model. You're like putting the
[14:39] hammer down and becoming the undisputed
[14:42] go-to expert for this one system in this
[14:44] one niche. Once you've built this
[14:45] machine and you're consistently hitting
[14:47] that $50,000 per month mark, firstly,
[14:49] congratulations. You've built a truly
[14:51] valuable business. And now, if you're
[14:52] ready, it's time to build your empire.
[14:54] Phase three, expand $50,000 to $300,000
[14:58] or more per month. So, by this point,
[14:59] you have a proven system, a solid
[15:01] reputation in your niche, and a small
[15:02] yet effective team. You've built a truly
[15:04] valuable business making you $50,000 or
[15:06] more a month. But now, you are going to
[15:07] face a whole new set of problems. You're
[15:09] probably drowning in sales calls. And
[15:11] your client acquisition with cold email
[15:13] is likely hitting a ceiling. And so, in
[15:14] order to break through this and get on
[15:16] the path to millionaire status, you're
[15:18] still not making enough money. So, the
[15:19] priority in this final phase is to build
[15:20] a multiaceted business that can scale
[15:22] far beyond your personal time and
[15:24] effort. This is about diversifying your
[15:26] revenue and diversifying your client
[15:28] acquisition in order to build a truly
[15:30] defensible and actually wealth
[15:31] generating machine. So there are three
[15:33] strategic plays that you need to make in
[15:34] this phase. First one is to delegate
[15:36] sales and free yourself from the last
[15:38] bits of agency work. So right now you
[15:40] are still the bottleneck. You delegated
[15:42] delivery to your developer but you are
[15:43] still tied down in those sales calls. In
[15:45] order to expand the business you must
[15:47] free yourself from this final
[15:48] operational task. And so your next hire
[15:50] is a salesperson. This person's sole job
[15:52] is to take over the sales calls and
[15:54] close the deals that your system's now
[15:55] generating. And this one move again is
[15:57] going to free up your single most
[15:59] valuable asset, which is your time, in
[16:00] order to focus on the highest leverage
[16:02] activity in the entire business. And
[16:04] that new job is play number two. Play
[16:06] number two is all about building your
[16:07] brand and your own niche. So with your
[16:09] time freed up from sales and delivery,
[16:11] your new full-time job is content
[16:13] creation, like doing this sort of stuff.
[16:15] So cold email got you to this point, but
[16:17] it does have a ceiling. And the way you
[16:18] attract the best clients and command the
[16:20] highest prices like we do at Morningside
[16:22] AI and build a real moat around your
[16:24] business is by becoming the undisputed
[16:27] go-to authority in your niche. And you
[16:29] do that by building a personal brand
[16:30] like I've done over the past 2 and a
[16:31] half years. And the strategy to do this
[16:33] is to firstly pick just one platform,
[16:35] YouTube or LinkedIn. I have seen
[16:36] incredible results on both. But just do
[16:38] one and go all in on that. You need to
[16:40] start sharing everything that you do.
[16:42] Talk about the results you're getting
[16:43] for clients. Share the systems you've
[16:44] built. Share personal updates on what
[16:47] you're doing. teach the solutions to the
[16:48] problems that your niche is facing. And
[16:50] the first step is by talking your
[16:52] and owning the fact that you are now an
[16:54] expert in that niche. And this is
[16:55] exactly what I've done over the past two
[16:56] and a half years. I've gone from having
[16:58] basically zero following to nearly a
[17:00] million across all my platforms. And
[17:02] that brand is what fuels my entire
[17:03] ecosystem of AI businesses that's on
[17:05] track to do over $10 million this year
[17:07] in revenues. So the personal brand, I
[17:09] can confidently say, is the single most
[17:10] powerful asset that you can build that
[17:12] will actually outlive the business that
[17:14] you're starting at this point. Your
[17:15] personal brand is still going to be with
[17:16] you in 10 20 years potentially. Then
[17:18] play number three is to increase your
[17:20] revenue streams. So your personal brand
[17:21] is going to create a powerful new asset
[17:23] which is attention and authority. Now
[17:25] you monetize that attention by expanding
[17:28] what you can sell. There are two proven
[17:29] paths that you can take at this point
[17:30] and it's best that entrepreneurs really
[17:32] consider doing both. Path A is going
[17:34] deeper with high ticket services for
[17:35] your agency. So you're no longer selling
[17:37] just one narrow AI system. You're now
[17:39] the trusted guide. Like you know these
[17:41] businesses inside out. You go from just
[17:43] being the niche AI automation agency to
[17:45] the full service AI transformation
[17:47] partner, which is what we've done at
[17:48] Morningside AI over the past 9 months.
[17:50] And the best entry point into expanding
[17:51] your services as an agency is to offer
[17:53] what's called an AI audit, where you go
[17:55] into business in your niche and you
[17:56] analyze their entire operation, identify
[17:58] all the opportunities for AI integration
[18:00] that you see. And not only do you get
[18:02] paid for that, but then you get paid for
[18:04] building the things that you identify as
[18:06] well. So, it's a really great model for
[18:07] increasing the lifetime value for
[18:08] customers. I've actually got a whole
[18:10] video on how we do this at Morningside,
[18:11] which I'll link down below if you want
[18:12] to watch. But basically, the AI audit
[18:14] becomes your entry point to selling a
[18:16] whole sort of complete AI transformation
[18:18] package, which includes education such
[18:20] as training the leadership and their
[18:21] teams. You have consulting and ongoing
[18:23] strategic guidance for the businesses
[18:25] that you work with. And there's also of
[18:26] course development, which is building
[18:27] out all the custom AI systems that they
[18:29] need, which as I said, this dramatically
[18:31] increases the lifetime value of each
[18:32] client and positions you as their
[18:33] indispensable partner for anything they
[18:35] need AI- wise. Then path B is to go into
[18:37] info products. And this is the ultimate
[18:39] revenue multiplier. You take the
[18:41] expertise of what you've proven in your
[18:42] agency and you package it into a course
[18:44] or a training program for your niche. So
[18:46] you're essentially teaching them like
[18:47] the the DIY or do it yourself strategy.
[18:49] You can think of it like AI for roofers
[18:51] 101 or the ultimate AI operations
[18:54] playbook for plumbing companies. So,
[18:55] you're taking all that valuable
[18:57] knowledge and experience that you've
[18:58] learned over all of the work you've done
[18:59] with your clients and you're packaging
[19:00] it into some kind of info product that
[19:02] you can sell over and over and over and
[19:04] over again without having to redeliver
[19:06] it. Whereas on the agency side, you were
[19:07] limited by how many clients you can
[19:09] actually deliver for. The info is only
[19:11] limited by how many people you can get
[19:12] interested in buying the info. A perfect
[19:14] example of this in action is with a guy
[19:16] called Nate Herk, who was a member of my
[19:18] AAA accelerator program who I
[19:19] interviewed recently here on this
[19:20] channel. And he started exactly where
[19:22] you are. He had no technical background,
[19:24] no AI knowledge, but he just started by
[19:26] building automations of businesses using
[19:27] the model that I've described here. He
[19:29] then built a YouTube channel and now he
[19:31] has an info product business that does
[19:32] over $200,000 a month from on top of his
[19:35] agency. So in total, he's making
[19:37] $300,000 every single month by combining
[19:39] these two models of services and info.
[19:42] And that's the final plate. So by
[19:43] freeing yourself up and delegating the
[19:45] sales, you get to pour all that time
[19:46] into building an undeniable personal
[19:47] brand. And then you can monetize that
[19:49] brand by going deeper with your high
[19:51] ticket services and then broader with
[19:53] scalable info products. So this is the
[19:55] path that takes you from a six-figure
[19:57] income to a seven figure net worth. And
[19:59] this is the guaranteed route to becoming
[20:01] a millionaire with AI. That's the plan
[20:03] guys. You have the map, the vehicle, the
[20:05] route, all the information. Your next
[20:07] step is super simple. As I promised, the
[20:09] full AI solarpreneurs guide, which is
[20:11] over 40 pages detailing exactly how to
[20:13] go from $0 to $10,000 per month, is in
[20:15] the first link in the description. And
